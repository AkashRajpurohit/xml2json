# FAQs

<details>
  <summary>What is the structure of the API response?</summary>
  <p>When converting from XML to JSON, in a success scenario the response would have a <kbd>json</kbd> key with the value as whatever the JSON response is generated when converting the XML response from the specified URL.

    Example:

```json
{
  "json": {
    "hello": "world"
  }
}
```

<details>
  <summary>The service is down, what should I do?</summary>
  <p>It is currently hosted on my personal Netlify account under the free plan along with my other stuff, there can be a case when this can go down. The simplest solution is that you can fork this repo and host an instance of your own on whichever infrastructure you prefer to use.</p>
